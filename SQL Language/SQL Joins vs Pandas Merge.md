1. **INNER JOIN:**
   - Returns only the rows where there is a match in both tables.

2. **LEFT JOIN (or LEFT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows from the left table and the matched rows from the right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the right table.

3. **RIGHT JOIN (or RIGHT OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows from the right table and the matched rows from the left table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the left table.

4. **FULL JOIN (or FULL OUTER JOIN):**
   - Returns all rows when there is a match in either the left or right table. If there is no match, NULL values are returned for columns from the table without a match.

5. **CROSS JOIN:**
   - Returns the Cartesian product of the two tables, i.e., all possible combinations of rows.

6. **SELF JOIN:**
   - Joins a table with itself. Useful when you want to combine rows within the same table based on a related column.

Now, regarding the similarity to Pandas merge functions:

Pandas, a popular Python library for data manipulation and analysis, provides a `merge` function that is similar to SQL joins. The key parameters of the Pandas `merge` function are:

- **`how` parameter:**
  - Similar to SQL joins, the `how` parameter in Pandas merge specifies the type of join. Options include 'inner', 'left', 'right', 'outer', and 'cross'.

- **`left` and `right` DataFrames:**
  - Correspond to the left and right tables in SQL joins.

- **`on` parameter:**
  - Specifies the column(s) on which to join the DataFrames, similar to the join condition in SQL.

- **`left_on` and `right_on` parameters:**
  - Allows you to specify different column names for the join condition in the left and right DataFrames.

- **`suffixes` parameter:**
  - Specifies suffixes to add to overlapping column names in case of a join on non-unique columns.

Pandas merge functions essentially provide a programmatic way to perform join operations on DataFrames, mirroring the functionality of SQL joins. Both are powerful tools for combining and analyzing data from multiple sources. Understanding SQL joins can help users transition between SQL and Pandas seamlessly when working with relational databases or data in tabular format.
